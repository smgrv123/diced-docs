## Marketing Ideas (Creating with Minimal Effort)

- Eating only "bahar ka kahana," boxes of pizza, and handis of biryani piled next to the bed. Dark somber music playing
- Gym boi trying to manage office, gym, and meals all together and messes everything up. Small idea, office call attending while dropping the phone in the cooker and goes into an anger fit
- Show a sequence where multiple characters (played by the same person) are debating what to cook, resulting in chaos and indecision. Cut to an easy solution with a FreshFit Meal Kit arriving at their door.
- A person is surrounded by confusing calculations and bewildered by a mountain of kitchen scales and measuring cups. Then, they switch to a FreshFit Meal Kit with clearly labeled macros, looking relieved and content.
- Follow a person carrying an unrealistic number of groceries, struggling through the store like a gym workout, with exaggerated effects (weights, treadmill sound effects). Transition to our delivery guy arriving with a FreshFit Meal Kit, instantly simplifying their life.
- Show the hilarity of a non-chef attempting to imitate a professional celebrity chef, complete with voiceover instructions hilariously gone wrong, followed by a switch to using a FreshFit Meal Kit that ensures they easily whip up an impressive dish.
- "Kitchen Olympics: 15-Minute Champion"
  - Concept: A person holding a golden spatula on a podium labeled “15-Minute Meals” while competitors struggle with complicated recipes.
  - Caption: “Fast. Healthy. Effortless. You’re always the winner with us.”
- "Your Microwave Is Jealous"
  - Visual: A microwave looking sad while someone cooks a fresh meal in 15 minutes.
  - Caption: “Move over, microwave. Fresh, healthy, and faster than a TV dinner.”

## Brand Story

(Story of how Freshana is Freshana today and what it wants to be tomorrow)

Busy lives deserve great meals. We started with a simple mission: to make it easy for people to enjoy balanced, nutritious meals without spending hours in the kitchen or compromising on the quality of the food with online channels. It's been a constant struggle to cook food quickly, easily, and healthily—and we knew we couldn’t be alone. 

So what we did was; source the freshest ingredients, create delicious, simple recipes, and develop a unique system to deliver meal kits that can be cooked from scratch in under 15 minutes. The result? A carefully crafted meal kit with recipes that saves you time, and makes staying & eating healthy a candid activity throughout your day, just like breathing. You are doing it, it's keeping you alive but you don't even realize it. 

And! all of it, while the meals don’t sacrifice flavor, and keeps you fueled for whatever life throws your way. With just a few steps, our kits turn fresh ingredients into a nutritious meal faster than a delivery app. We’re excited to build a future where everyone can make home-cooked meals part of their daily routine, no matter how busy they are. Join us on our mission, and experience a new way to cook—one that’s simple, fast, and cooked just for you.
