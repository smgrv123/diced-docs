Hi [investor/vc]

I'm Sumrit, the co-founder of Diced. Our company plans to provide **pre-portioned, ready to cook** meal kits that would simplify cooking healthy meals at home. We plan to start our operations in Bangalore. We believe our company would be a great fit in your portfolio

Early signs of traction:
-  The target audience shows signs of early demand for a 15-min healthy meal format
- CAC at ₹47 shows we can acquire customers affordably.
- Users signed up from multiple cities, showing future promise for expansion.

Here’s why we believe in this market:

- The healthy food market in India is projected to reach **$30 billion by 2026**, growing at a **CAGR of 20%** 
- There is a change in the attitude and increase in the number of health-conscious consumer post covid

Please do let me know if the above proposal appeals to you and I would be happy to schedule a meeting at your most convenient time.

Best Regards  
Sumrit Grover
