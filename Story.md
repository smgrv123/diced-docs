### Elevator pitch 
so i stumbled upon this idea a few months back when my house help was on a long leave and I had to resort to ordering food from zomato or swiggy. And even though I was looking for rice bowls, non veg thali or anything that would not be considered junk, I still had the regret of ordering out. I had no idea of the quality of the ingredients used, hygiene of the kitchen, and most of all I had no idea about the macros that I had consumed. 

A few days later I had enough of all of this, I decided that I am going to cook myself. And because I am not a great cook, it took me at least an hour to prepare and cook everything. But most of my time was spent cutting, chopping and preparing for the entire meal. I spent approximately 15 mins cooking everything, and that is when i thought to myself what if there was a service that would give me pre-prepped meals that I just have to cook in 15 mins. No hassle, no onion tears, no messy kitchen. Just a pan, a skillet and I am ready with my food

A few months ago, my house help took a long leave, and I found myself relying heavily on Zomato and Swiggy. Even when I tried to order healthier options like rice bowls or non-veg thalis, I always had this nagging regret. I had no idea about the **quality of ingredients**, the **kitchen hygiene**, or, crucially, the **nutritional macros** I was consuming.

After a few days of this, I'd had enough. I decided to cook for myself. Now, I'm no chef, so it would take me at least an hour to get a meal ready. But what really struck me was that most of that time was spent on **prep**: all the cutting, chopping, and getting everything organized. The actual cooking part? That took about 15 minutes.

That's when it hit me: What if there was a service that provided **pre-prepped meals**? All you'd have to do is cook for 15 minutes. No hassle, no onion tears, no messy kitchen. Just a pan, a skillet, and you're good to go with a healthy, home-cooked meal.
